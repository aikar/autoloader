## About
Autoloads JS files based on name when the class is needed.
This is designed to be used with Joose classes in the "Foo.Bar.Baz" format

This module removes the needs of using require() all over your files. Simply
define the autoloader to your codebase, and use the names relative to the files.

ie lib/Foo/Bar/Baz.js when you load 'lib/' makes Foo.Bar.Baz
require('./lib/Foo/Bar/Baz.js') automatically and return the value.

## Install

Install with npm install autoloader

## Usage

Folder structure:

    /lib/
        Foo/
            Foo.js
            Bar.js
    test.js
    package.json (main: 'test.js')
    
File contents:

Foo.js:

    module.exports = function() {
        console.log("Foo")
        Foo.Bar();
    };

Bar.js:

    module.exports = function() {
        console.log("Foo.Bar")
    };


test.js:
    
    require('autoloader').autoload(__dirname + '/lib')
    Foo();


loading the module would print to screen:

    Foo
    Foo.Bar
    
ALL MODULES MUST RETURN AN OBJECT/FUNCTION. It can not return Primitive Values!

## Custom Loaders
If you pass a function as the 2nd argument, autoloader will execute that before
requiring the file with the following arguments:

    function (fullPath, className, object, key) { }
    
fullPath will be the full path to the module file to load, classname would
be 'Foo.Bar.Baz' for example, object would be the object to add a new value
to, and key is the key of object to assign the response.

so if you load 'Foo', object is global, and key is Foo, likewise if you load
Foo.Bar, object is Foo and key is 'Bar'.
You can then do what ever magic it is you need to do, and optionally assign it yourself.

If you don't assign it yourself, simply return the value and autoloader will
assign it for you.
